# Frontend

## Frontend code

Below is the directory structure that makes up the front end (key files highlighted).

```
- public/
  - index.html
  - profile.html
  - styles.css
```

The front end is written in HTML/CSS with the Bootstrap v4.0.0 styling framework, and JavaScript/jQuery v3.1.1 for handling dynamic content. All the code is in the `public/` directory:

HTML:

- index.html is our landing/login page
- profile.html is a user profile page.

CSS:

- styles.css contains styles for all pages, and is imported by every HTML page.

JavaScript:

- As of now we do not have any JavaScript files that were not auto-generated.
