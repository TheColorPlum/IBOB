# Backend

The back end is built with Node.js... *introduction coming soon*

## Testing

Tests for the back end are written using the Mocha testing framework. They are placed in the `tests/` directory, shown below:

```
- tests/
  - api-putComment.js
  - api-putLike.js
  - api-putShare.js
  - ...
```

As of now, we only have some tests for our API written. To keep the organization simple, we use a simple naming convention for these tests: prefix with `api-`, followed by the name of the function being tested.
